Deployment and lifecycle management for Stellar/Soroban smart contracts.

SoroForge turns contract deployment into a tracked, repeatable workflow with a
recorded history — so you manage contracts the way you manage any other deployed
software.

## Why

Deploying Soroban contracts today is a pile of one-off CLI invocations with no
memory. A week later, nobody can answer:

- Which WASM hash is live on testnet? On mainnet? Are they the same build?
- What changed between the version that's live and the one in `main`?
- Who deployed it, when, and which transaction did it?
- Has anyone changed it since?

The answers live in someone's shell history, if they live anywhere. SoroForge
records every deploy and upgrade in Postgres — contract ID, WASM hash, network,
deployer address, transaction, ledger, and free-form notes — and can verify that
record against the chain on demand.

That last part matters most. A deployment tracker that never checks itself will
confidently report stale information. `soroforge status` compares the WASM hash
the contract is *actually* running against the one SoroForge recorded, and tells
you when they disagree.

---

## Verified SDK and RPC versions

Soroban's deployment flow and RPC surface change. Everything below was verified
against the live API rather than recalled, and the live smoke tests
(`make test-live`) exist so you can re-verify after an upgrade.

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [`github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk`](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk) | **v0.7.1** | The SDK repository was renamed from `github.com/stellar/go` in the October 2025 refactor. The old path is not used. |
| `clients/rpcclient` | (in SDK v0.7.1) | The Soroban RPC client now ships inside the SDK. No separate `stellar-rpc` client module is needed. |
| `protocols/rpc` | (in SDK v0.7.1) | Request/response types, imported as `protocol`. |
| Stellar RPC | Protocol 23 era | Field names verified against the SDK source; several differ from older tutorials. |
| Go | 1.25 | Required by the SDK's own `go.mod`. |

Two details that trip up code written from older examples:

- **Field names changed.** The simulation response uses `TransactionDataXDR`,
  `MinResourceFee`, `Results[].ReturnValueXDR`, and `Results[].AuthXDR`;
  resources use `DiskReadBytes` (formerly `ReadBytes`).
- **There is no `AssembleTransaction` helper in the Go SDK**, unlike the
  JavaScript SDK. SoroForge assembles transactions itself in
  [`internal/stellar/assemble.go`](internal/stellar/assemble.go): it decodes the
  simulated `SorobanTransactionData`, attaches it and the recorded auth entries
  to the operation, and rebuilds the transaction so that `txnbuild` recomputes
  the fee as `BaseFee × operations + ResourceFee`.

Other pinned dependencies: `pgx/v5 v5.10.0`, `golang-migrate/v4 v4.19.1`,
`cobra v1.10.2`, `chi/v5 v5.3.1`, `testify v1.11.1`, `yaml.v3 v3.0.1`.

## How deploying works

Worth knowing, because it explains the command output.

**Deploy is two transactions.** Soroban permits one host function per
transaction, so SoroForge first uploads the bytecode — which becomes addressable
by its SHA-256 hash — and then creates a contract instance from that hash. The
instance gets an address; the bytecode is shared by every contract using it. If
the bytecode is already on-chain, the upload is skipped.

**Upgrade is not a protocol operation.** Soroban has no "upgrade" instruction. A
contract upgrades *itself* through a function it chooses to expose, typically:

```rust
pub fn upgrade(env: Env, new_wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
    let admin: Address = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap();
    admin.require_auth();
    env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm(new_wasm_hash);
}
```

SoroForge uploads the new bytecode and invokes that function. A contract that
doesn't expose one **cannot be upgraded**, and SoroForge will report the
contract's own error. The entrypoint name defaults to `upgrade` and is
configurable per contract via `upgrade_fn`.

A confirmed transaction is not proof the code changed: an upgrade entrypoint
could accept the call and do something else. So after the transaction confirms,
SoroForge reads the contract's on-chain WASM hash back — retrying briefly while
the ledger closes — and only then reports success and records the upgrade. If
the contract still runs something else, the upgrade fails with both hashes and
nothing is recorded.

---

## Quickstart — deploy to testnet

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.25+, Docker (for Postgres), a compiled contract `.wasm`,
and a funded testnet account.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soroworks/soroforge.git
cd soroforge
make build
```

**1. Start Postgres and create the schema.**

```bash
docker compose up -d
make migrate-up
```

**2. Configure your project.** From your contract project, after
`stellar contract build`:

```bash
soroforge init
```

`init` finds the release WASM under `target/wasm32v1-none/release` (or the
older `wasm32-unknown-unknown`), preferring a `.optimized.wasm`, and writes a
`soroforge.yaml` with one alias per contract, targeting testnet:

```yaml
contracts:
  counter:
    wasm: "./target/wasm32v1-none/release/counter.wasm"
```

It never replaces an existing file without `--force`.

**3. Provide credentials.**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `DATABASE_URL`, and a deployer key via either `SOROFORGE_SECRET_KEY` or
`SOROFORGE_KEYSTORE_PATH`. Fund the account at
<https://friendbot.stellar.org> if you haven't. Read the [security
notes](#security-notes-on-key-handling) first.

**4. Dry run.** This assembles and simulates both transactions, prints the
contract address a real deploy would produce, and submits and records nothing:

```bash
./bin/soroforge deploy counter --network testnet --dry-run
```

A dry run doesn't need `DATABASE_URL`, so it doubles as a config check.

**5. Deploy for real.**

```bash
./bin/soroforge deploy counter --network testnet --notes "v1.0.0"
```

**6. Confirm it's tracked, and that the record is true.**

```bash
./bin/soroforge list
./bin/soroforge history counter
./bin/soroforge status counter
```

---

## Configuration reference

`soroforge.yaml` holds what's shareable and belongs in version control. Secrets
come from the environment and never go in this file. Unknown keys are rejected,
so a typo is a loud error rather than a silently ignored setting.

```yaml
version: 1                  # schema version; only 1 exists
default_network: testnet    # used when --network is omitted

networks:
  testnet:
    rpc_url: https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
    passphrase: "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
    sorovault_url: http://localhost:8080   # optional

contracts:
  counter:
    wasm: ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/counter.wasm
    constructor_args: []    # optional
    upgrade_fn: upgrade     # optional, defaults to "upgrade"
    salt: ""                # optional 32-byte hex
    networks:               # optional per-network overrides
      mainnet:
        constructor_args:
          - {type: address, value: GABC...}
        salt: "00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff"
```

**Networks.** Any number, named freely. The passphrase is required rather than
inferred from the name — it's mixed into every signature, so a wrong value
produces a transaction that's invalid on the network you meant to use, and a
silently defaulted one could sign a mainnet deploy with testnet assumptions.

There is **no public SDF-hosted mainnet RPC**. Point `mainnet` at a provider you
trust or at your own node.

**`sorovault_url`** registers every confirmed deploy and upgrade with a
[SoroVault](https://github.com/soroworks/sorovault) registry serving that
network, so the contract's functions, types and events are discoverable the
moment it is live — and [SoroProbe](https://github.com/soroworks/soroprobe)
can type its arguments from them. An upgrade records a new interface version
and keeps the old one. Registration happens only after on-chain confirmation
and is best-effort: if SoroVault is down, the deploy still succeeds and is
recorded, and the output (`catalog` in JSON) says registration failed so you
can run `sorovault add` later. Dry runs never register anything.

**Contracts.** `wasm` paths resolve against the config file's directory, not your
shell's working directory, so `soroforge deploy` behaves the same from anywhere.

**`salt`** makes a contract's address reproducible: addresses derive from
(deployer address, salt). Leave it unset and each deploy uses a random salt, so
deploying the same alias twice produces two distinct contracts.

**`networks`** overrides `constructor_args` and `salt` for one network: the
per-network value wins when that network is deployed to, and the contract-level
value is the default everywhere else (`wasm` and `upgrade_fn` are not
overridable). An explicit `constructor_args: []` in an override means "no
arguments on this network" — an empty list clears the contract default rather
than inheriting it — while an empty `salt` inherits the contract's. Both names
must match a network configured under `networks:`; an unknown one is a load
error reported with its full path, e.g.
`contracts.token.networks.mainnet.salt: unknown network (configured: testnet)`.

### Constructor arguments

Soroban takes arguments as XDR `ScVal` values, which nobody wants to hand-write.
Write them typed instead:

```yaml
constructor_args:
  - {type: address, value: GABC...}
  - {type: u32, value: 7}
  - {type: string, value: "Example Token"}
  - {type: i128, value: "170141183460469231731687303715884105727"}
  - {type: vec, value: [{type: u32, value: 1}, {type: u32, value: 2}]}
  - {type: map, value: [{key: {type: symbol, value: decimals},
                         value: {type: u32, value: 7}}]}
```

| Type | Value form |
|---|---|
| `bool` | `true` / `false` |
| `void` | omit `value` |
| `u32` `i32` `u64` `i64` | decimal integer |
| `u128` `i128` | decimal integer **as a quoted string** |
| `string` `symbol` | text (`symbol` is `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`, max 32 chars) |
| `bytes` | hex, with or without `0x` |
| `address` | `G...` account or `C...` contract |
| `vec` | a list of args |
| `map` | a list of `{key, value}` pairs |
| `xdr` | base64 `ScVal` — the escape hatch |

Quote anything beyond float64's exact range, or YAML will round it before
SoroForge sees it. The `xdr` type accepts a pre-encoded `ScVal`, so a type not
listed here is never a hard block.

Adding a type means one case in
[`internal/config/args.go`](internal/config/args.go) and one table entry in its
test.

#### Overriding arguments for one deploy

`deploy` can replace the configured arguments for a single run:

```bash
soroforge deploy counter --arg u32:7 --arg string:"Example Token"
soroforge deploy counter --args-file args.json
```

`--arg TYPE:VALUE` is repeatable and accepts the same types as the config file.
Only the first colon separates the type from the value, so a value may contain
one (`string:https://example.org`). `--args-file` points at a JSON array in the
same `{type, value}` shape — the only form that can express nested `vec` and
`map` arguments:

```json
[
  {"type": "u32", "value": 7},
  {"type": "vec", "value": [{"type": "symbol", "value": "a"}]}
]
```

The two flags are mutually exclusive, and the replacement applies to that one
deploy only: nothing in `soroforge.yaml` changes, and nothing is submitted
until the arguments validate. The typed arguments actually used — after
per-network overrides and any replacement — are recorded with the deployment
in the `constructor_args` column and shown by `history`, so a deploy can be
reproduced after the config has moved on. Neither flag works with `--all`,
which deploys each contract with its configured arguments.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string. Required except for `deploy --dry-run`. |
| `SOROFORGE_SECRET_KEY` | Deployer secret seed (`S...`). |
| `SOROFORGE_KEYSTORE_PATH` | Path to a file containing only the seed. |
| `SOROFORGE_API_TOKEN` | Bearer token for `serve`. Required to start it. |
| `SOROFORGE_API_ADDR` | Listen address (default `127.0.0.1:8080`). |
| `SOROFORGE_CONFIG` | Config file path (default `./soroforge.yaml`). |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Enables Postgres integration tests. |
| `SOROFORGE_LIVE` | Enables the live testnet smoke tests. |

## CLI reference

Global flags: `--config/-c`, `--network/-n`, `--log-level`, `--json`.
Output goes to stdout and logs to stderr, so `--json` output stays pipeable.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `init` | Write a starter `soroforge.yaml` for the contracts built under `target/`. |
| `deploy <alias>` | Upload WASM, instantiate the contract, record it. `--arg`/`--args-file` override `constructor_args` for this run. |
| `deploy --all` | Deploy every configured contract not yet tracked on the network, in alias order. |
| `upgrade <alias>` | Upload new WASM and invoke the contract's upgrade entrypoint. |
| `list` | List tracked contracts; `--network` filters. |
| `history <alias>` | Show a contract's full deploy/upgrade timeline, newest first. |
| `status <alias>` | Compare the on-chain WASM hash against the recorded one. |
| `status --all` | Drift-check every tracked contract on the network, for a single CI gate. |
| `serve` | Run the HTTP API. |
| `migrate up\|down\|version` | Manage the schema. |
| `version` | Print the SoroForge version. |

`deploy` and `upgrade` accept `--dry-run` and `--notes`.

**`--dry-run`** runs everything up to and including simulation and assembly,
then stops. It prints the assembled envelopes and the resulting contract
address, and writes nothing and submits nothing. It's safe to point at mainnet.

**`deploy --all`** fills in every contract the network doesn't have yet:
already-tracked aliases are skipped with a message, the rest are deployed in
alias order. The first failure stops the run, and the summary reports what
succeeded before it, so a partial run is never a mystery. `--dry-run` works
with `--all`, and `--json` returns an array of per-alias results whose `status`
is one of `deployed`, `dry_run`, `skipped`, or `failed`.

Contracts are processed in alias order, and SoroForge does not infer
dependencies between them: if one contract's constructor needs another
contract's address, deploy them individually in the order you need.

**`status` exit codes** make it usable as a CI gate:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | In sync. |
| `1` | The check could not be completed. |
| `2` | Drift, untracked, or missing on-chain. |

The four states it reports:

- **`in_sync`** — the chain matches the record.
- **`drift`** — the contract is running bytecode SoroForge didn't deploy.
  Someone changed it another way.
- **`untracked`** — SoroForge has no record of this contract on this network.
- **`missing`** — SoroForge has a record, but the chain has no such contract.

---

## HTTP API reference

Mirrors the CLI, for CI pipelines that can't easily run a binary. Both surfaces
call the same service, so behaviour cannot drift between them.

```bash
soroforge serve
```

Every `/v1` endpoint requires `Authorization: Bearer $SOROFORGE_API_TOKEN`. The
server **refuses to start without a token** — see the security notes.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness. No auth. |
| `POST` | `/v1/deploy` | `{"alias","network","notes","dry_run"}` → `201` (`200` for a dry run). |
| `POST` | `/v1/upgrade` | Same body → `200`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/contracts?network=` | Tracked contracts. |
| `GET` | `/v1/contracts/{network}/{alias}/history` | Deployment history. |
| `GET` | `/v1/contracts/{network}/{alias}/status` | Drift check. |
| `GET` | `/v1/contracts/{network}/status` | Drift check of every tracked contract; `in_sync` is the verdict. |

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOROFORGE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"alias":"counter","network":"testnet","dry_run":true}'
```

Unknown JSON fields are rejected, so a misspelled `dry_run` fails loudly instead
of deploying for real. Failures return `{"error": "..."}`; drift returns `200`
with `"state":"drift"`, because the check ran and produced an answer.

## Security notes on key handling

**SoroForge reads a key you provide. It does not generate, store, rotate, or
manage keys** — that's deliberate, and out of scope.

**What SoroForge does with your key:**

- Reads the seed from `SOROFORGE_SECRET_KEY` or the file at
  `SOROFORGE_KEYSTORE_PATH`. If both are set, the environment variable wins, so
  CI can override a developer's on-disk key.
- Passes it straight into a signer, which holds it unexported.
- Records only the derived public `G...` address.

**What it never does:** log the seed at any level, write it to the database,
include it in `--json` output or API responses, or echo it in an error message —
a malformed seed is still a secret, and errors end up in CI logs.
`Env.Redacted()` reports every secret as `(set)`/`(unset)`.

**Recommendations:**

- Prefer a **keystore file** locally, at mode `0600`. Environment variables are
  readable by every child process and land in shell history.
- Use your CI provider's secret store for `SOROFORGE_SECRET_KEY`. Don't commit
  `.env` — it's gitignored, keep it that way.
- Use a **separate key per network**. A mainnet deploy key shouldn't be on a
  laptop that also deploys to testnet.
- Always `--dry-run` against mainnet first.

**HTTP API:** the server refuses to start without `SOROFORGE_API_TOKEN`, and
rejects tokens shorter than 16 characters. Tokens are compared in constant time,
since a naive comparison leaks how much of the token matched through response
timing. It binds `127.0.0.1` by default because this process holds a signing
key; widen that only behind your own TLS and authentication. Generate a real
token with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

**Not implemented, by design:** key generation, multisig or threshold signing,
hardware wallets, and CI plugin integrations. The `stellar.Signer` interface is
the extension point for the signing-related ones — see
[`internal/stellar/signer.go`](internal/stellar/signer.go).

---

## Architecture

```
cmd/soroforge/      cobra CLI
internal/config/    soroforge.yaml + env loading, validation, ScVal encoding
internal/stellar/   RPC client, transaction assembly, signing (all interfaced)
internal/deploy/    deploy/upgrade/status orchestration
internal/store/     Postgres history + embedded migrations
internal/api/       chi HTTP handlers mirroring the CLI
internal/catalog/   best-effort registration with SoroVault after a deploy
```

Three interfaces are the seams: `stellar.Client` (RPC), `stellar.Signer`
(signing), and `store.Store` (persistence). Each has a production implementation
and an in-memory one, which is why `go test ./...` needs neither a network nor a
database.

`stellar.Client` deliberately speaks base64 XDR strings rather than SDK structs,
so a fake needs no XDR plumbing. Everything that interprets XDR — building
operations, assembling simulated transactions, deriving contract IDs — is a pure
function, tested directly.

### Data model

`contracts` holds current state, one row per contract per network, unique on
`(network, alias)`. `deployments` is append-only: an upgrade adds a row rather
than modifying one, so the rows for a contract *are* its version history. The
typed constructor arguments a deploy used are stored per row in
`deployments.constructor_args` as JSON, next to the free-form `notes`. Both are
indexed on `(network, contract_id)`.

Records are written **only after on-chain confirmation**. A history claiming a
deploy that never landed is worse than no history.

---

## Testing

```bash
make test          # no network, no database
make test-race
make test-integration   # adds the Postgres suite (needs docker compose up -d)
make test-live          # read-only smoke tests against live testnet
```

`go test ./...` never requires a network or a database — the Postgres and live
tests skip unless their environment variable is set. The Postgres suite runs the
*same* test suite as the in-memory store, which keeps the fake honest about
matching real database semantics.

The live tests are read-only (no keys, no submissions, no fees). They exist
because the rest of the suite proves SoroForge is internally consistent, not
that its understanding of the RPC API is still correct. Run them after upgrading
the Stellar SDK.
